description: |
  This document defines device tree properties common to several motion control
  devices. It doesn't constitute a device tree binding specification by itself
  but is meant to be referenced by device tree bindings.

  When referenced from motion device tree bindings the properties defined in
  this document are defined as follows. The motion device tree bindings are
  responsible for defining whether each property is required or optional.

properties:
  speed-conv-mul:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    default: 1
    description:
      Numerator of a fractional representation of a speed conversion factor.
      The speed conversion factor (represented by numerator and denominator)
      is multiplied with the internal speed unit to obtain the physical speed
      unit of the controller. For example, for a stepper motor controller, the
      physical speed unit is microsteps/second (Hz).

  speed-conv-div:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    default: 1
    minimum: 1
    description:
      Denominator of fractional representation of a speed conversion factor.

  acceleration-conv-mul:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    default: 1
    description:
      Numerator of a fractional representation of an acceleration conversion
      factor.

  acceleration-conv-div:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    default: 1
    minimum: 1
    description:
      Denominator of fractional representation of an acceleration conversion
      factor.
